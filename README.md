## What Drives the Price of a Car?

## Context
### According to Perplexity:
##### The price of a car is determined by various factors, including the Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price (MSRP), mileage, condition, location, options, and color. The MSRP is the base price set by the manufacturer, which can be further influenced by additional features and add-on products. Mileage and condition are the primary factors affecting a used vehicle's price, with options, location, and color also playing a role. Other factors such as trim level, optional equipment, and the region where the car is being sold also contribute to the price.

## Business Understanding
#### Many of the features in the dataset provided for this project are described in the "Context".  We can leverage this data and tweak them to find the best model and price estimates.  The initial focus will be to build a codebase that can be leveraged with modifications afterwards.  

## Data Understanding

#### Here are some Pie Charts that show proportions in the some of the features.
#### These will be useful later during my insights.

#### Here are some Heatmaps visualizing the magnitude of individual values.
##### We can see that "odometer" has a negative correlation with price (-0.4) and model year (-0.47).
##### We can see that "drive" has a negative correlation with price (-0.18) and model year (-0.12).
##### We can see that "size" has a negative correlation with price (-0.088) and model year (-0.075).
##### These features will be dropped.

##### Here is the Heat Map that will drive the selection of features for our modeling.

### Modeling
#### Using "train_test_split" on the data we derived from the Heatmaps, we end up with 
21,733 records for training
 9,314 records for testing

#### Applying Linear Regression
Coefficients: 
[5.75105537e-01 3.00495003e+03 3.26941663e+02 5.24749893e+02]

#### With Intercept: 0, Plain Linear Regression is the best option
#### Here is the Box Plot for that model

#### Something unsusal appears when we plot the Test Prices vs Predicted Prices
##### The Price Predictions in orange are much shorter than the Test Prices.

##### But there NO NEGATIVE price predctions!

#### Building a DataFrame to organize our Model Predictions we can produce a Box Plot
<img src="images/Box_Plot_4.png"/>

#### When we run Simple Cross Validation, the results indicate that the Polynomial Degree 4 is the best option.
#### The Complexity that Minimized Test Error is also 4.
<img src="/images/Degree_Complexity.png">

#### However, something unsusal appears when we plot the Test Prices vs Predicted Prices for Degree 2.
##### The Price Predictions in orange are a little bit shorter than the Test Prices, but better than the predictions from Plain Linear Regression.

##### However, there NO NEGATIVE price predctions!

### Evaluation
#### Standard Feature selection produces
#####  best R2: 0.12
#####  worst Mean squared error: 149,420,617.16
#####  worst Mean absolute error: 9,153.10
#### The R2=0.12 indicates a good fit with the observed data compared with the other R2 scores.

### Next steps and recommendations
#### I recommend a cautious approach to build your inventory.
#### Your sales people can tell you what shoppers are saying and how they feel about what's for sale.
#### Find tools that help identify vehicles that suit your local demographics.
#### Price those vehicles strategically to get the most profit.
#### Leverage your network of financers to get the reasonable interest rates to maximize your cash floor.
